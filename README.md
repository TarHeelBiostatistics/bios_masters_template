# Latex Template for UNC Biostatistics Master's Papers
This template provides a rough outline of the formatting standards for master's papers in the UNC Department of Biostatistics. This template is based on the standards in the [2013-2014 Academic Information Manual](http://sph.unc.edu/files/2013/12/BIOS_AIM_2013_14.pdf).

## Instructions
* Save the template.tex and biosmasters.cls to your computer. Rename template.tex to whateveryouwant.tex.
* Edit whateveryouwant.tex adding your title, name, date, and content.
* For bibliography formating, you'll need a .bst file. The default for biosmaster's class is based on the JASA style. A bst file is available [here](http://www.math.montana.edu/stat/tutorials/texstuff/jasa.bst).
* Compile.
